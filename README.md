# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-and-Visualization
Presenting the COVID-19 Data Visualization Dashboard. I've transformed raw data from ourworldindata.org into a powerful tool for understanding the pandemic. Discover global trends with interactive charts and maps. Explore continents, income groups, and individual countries' data. Join me in analyzing the impact of COVID-19.
This repository contains the code and resources for the COVID-19 Data Visualization Dashboard, a project created using data from Our World in Data Org. The project involves data cleaning, analysis using SQL, and the development of an interactive dashboard for visualizing COVID-19 statistics, including deaths, infections, and vaccinations.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: The data sourced from Our World in Data was cleaned and analyzed using SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**: The project includes an interactive dashboard with four main sheets:

   - Bar and line graphs of total new cases and total new deaths from January 2020 to October 2023.
   - Pie chart representing infected and deceased percentages for continents, along with population data.
   - Treemap displaying vaccination and death percentages over income groups.
   - World map illustrating the percentage of population infected, vaccinated, and deceased for each country.

## Dashboard Sheets

1. **Total Cases and Deaths Over Time**:
   - Bar graph and line graph displaying total new cases and total new deaths from January 2020 to October 2023.

2. **Continent Statistics**:
